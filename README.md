============

Driftwood a dirt simple logging framework for javascript


The following goals of drift wood :

* Logging should be simple, this isn't java we don't need abstract interfaces just a few simple options.
* 4 Log levels thats it.
* Allow exceptions or logs to be sent to a backend server. If an error falls in the forrest and no one heres it did it really happen?
